# wheel-of-fortune

## Instructions
The main point of the game is to make as much money as you can while guessing letters that make up a word or phrase. A hint is shared with players at the beginning of each round and consists of a masked version of the word made up of one underscore for each letter. As letters are guessed the blanks/underscores are replaced with the correctly guessed letter.

Each turn a player can spin the wheel, buy a vowel (which costs $250), or guess the word. They can continue to buy vowels as long as the vowels appear. If a word is down to vowels, each round is played with players being able to buy vowels.

On their turn, a player can guess the answer. If they successfully guess the answer, they win the round. If they do not successfully guess the answer, that consumes their turn.

For our game, there are two rounds with three players. The winner of the round keeps their round winnings as total winnings. All players' round banks reset to zero at the beginning of each round. The player with the most money at the end of round two goes on to round three.
